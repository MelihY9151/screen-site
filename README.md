The reason we decided to compleate this project was that we needed to be tested on how we have learned css and html so far in the year.I learned that sometimes haver does not work properly and have tried to learn what the issue was but had no sucsess even gogling did not help me whit my issue.I tried to change how the background color whould effect it by either using #color# and #background-color#.One thing I learned was how to change the position of iteams by using #left# and then how it will shift whitout using margin or padding.
